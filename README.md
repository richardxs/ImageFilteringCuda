# Image filtering (lowpass/highpass filtering) using NVIDIA NPP with CUDA

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of NVIDIA Performance Primitives (NPP) library with CUDA to perform image filtering. More specifically, the goal is to utilize GPU acceleration to efficiently filter a given image through a lowpass filter (for example, Gaussian filter) and a high pass filter, leveraging the computational power of modern GPUs. While the lowpass filter (e.g., Gaussian filter) smooths the image by removing the high-frequency details, the highpass filter will keep those details. Comparing the lowpass/highpass filtered results of a series of example images (i.e., `Lena`, `tree`, `couple`, `girl`, `woman`), I have learned the drastic differences in effects of the two filters. 

The project is a part of the CUDA at Scale for the Enterprise course and serves as a example for understanding how to implement basic image processing operations using CUDA and NPP.

## Code Organization

```bin/```
This folder hold all binary/executable code that is built automatically.

```data/```
This folder should hold all example images in `*.pgm` format(original and lowpass/highpass filtered).

```lib/```
This folder includes extra library dependency.

```src/```
This folder includes source code.

```README.md```
This file should hold the description of the project so that anyone cloning or deciding if they want to clone this repository can understand its purpose to help with their decision.

```Makefile or CMAkeLists.txt or build.sh```
There should be some rudimentary scripts for building your project's code in an automatic fashion.

```run.sh```
An optional script used to run your executable code, either with or without command-line arguments.

## Supported OSes

## CUDA APIs involved

## Dependencies needed to build/run
[FreeImage](../../README.md#freeimage), [NPP](../../README.md#npp)

## Prerequisites

Download and install the [CUDA Toolkit 11.4](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for your corresponding platform.
Make sure the dependencies mentioned in [Dependencies]() section above are installed.

## Build and Run

### Windows
The Windows samples are built using the Visual Studio IDE. Solution files (.sln) are provided for each supported version of Visual Studio, using the format:
```
*_vs<version>.sln - for Visual Studio <version>
```
Each individual sample has its own set of solution files in its directory:

To build/examine all the samples at once, the complete solution files should be used. To build/examine a single sample, the individual sample solution files should be used.
> **Note:** Some samples require that the Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010 or newer) be installed and that the VC++ directory paths are properly set up (**Tools > Options...**). Check DirectX Dependencies section for details."

### Linux
The Linux samples are built using makefiles. To use the makefiles, change the current directory to the sample directory you wish to build, and run make:
```
$ cd <sample_dir>
$ make
```
The samples makefiles can take advantage of certain options:
*  **TARGET_ARCH=<arch>** - cross-compile targeting a specific architecture. Allowed architectures are x86_64, ppc64le, armv7l.
    By default, TARGET_ARCH is set to HOST_ARCH. On a x86_64 machine, not setting TARGET_ARCH is the equivalent of setting TARGET_ARCH=x86_64.<br/>
`$ make TARGET_ARCH=x86_64` <br/> `$ make TARGET_ARCH=ppc64le` <br/> `$ make TARGET_ARCH=armv7l` <br/>
    See [here](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-samples/index.html#cross-samples) for more details.
*   **dbg=1** - build with debug symbols
    ```
    $ make dbg=1
    ```
*   **SMS="A B ..."** - override the SM architectures for which the sample will be built, where `"A B ..."` is a space-delimited list of SM architectures. For example, to generate SASS for SM 50 and SM 60, use `SMS="50 60"`.
    ```
    $ make SMS="50 60"
    ```

*  **HOST_COMPILER=<host_compiler>** - override the default g++ host compiler. See the [Linux Installation Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#system-requirements) for a list of supported host compilers.
```
    $ make HOST_COMPILER=g++
```
